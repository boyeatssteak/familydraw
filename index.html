    <h1>Family Draw Machine</h1>
    <p>Type the names that will be participating in the draw in the box below. I'm only setup to handle names without spaces or special characters, so if you have any concerns, maybe try a test run and check the spoilers to make sure it worked like you want it to, then come back and do a new shuffle.</p>
    <p>For a simple draw, where everyone can draw anyone else (except themselves), just put each name on its own line. If you want a fancy draw where spouses or siblings can't draw each other, put their names on the same row.</p>
    <h4>Example 1: Simple Draw</h4>
    <pre>
      Wakko
      Yakko
      Dot
      Pinky
      TheBrain
      Buttons
      Mindy
      TheMime
    </pre>
    <p>These Animaniacs can each draw any other Animaniac, Wakko could draw Yakko, Pinky could draw TheBrain</p>
    <h4>Example 2: Fancy Draw</h4>
    <pre>
      Bubs CoachZ
      Homestar Marzipan
      StrongBad StrongSad StrongMad
      TheCheat
    </pre>
    <p>Homestar and Marzipan can't draw each other, but they could draw anyone else. The brothers Strong would not draw each other, but could draw everyone else. TheCheat would not be limited at all, and could end up drawing anyone.</p>
